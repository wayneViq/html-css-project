          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. <br>
            <br> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: <br>
            <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_should_you_already_know">
          <header>What should you already know</header>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
          <header>Hello world</header>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: <br>
            <br>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br> greetMe("World"); </code>
            <br>
            <br> Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! <br>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
            <br> With the keyword var. For example, <br>
            <br>
            <code>var x = 42</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>x = 42. <br>
              <br> let y = 13. </code>
            <br>
            <br> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
          <header>Declaring variables</header>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. <br>
            <br> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). <br>
            <br> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. <br>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="IF...ELSE_STATEMENT">
          <header>IF...ELSE_STATEMENT</header>
          <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: <br>
            <br>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <br>
            <br> condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements. <br>
            <br>
            <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { <br> statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { <br> statement_last; } </code>
            <br>
            <br> In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements: <br>
            <br>
            <code> if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br> statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else { <br> statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br> statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } </code>
            <br>
          </p>
        </section>
